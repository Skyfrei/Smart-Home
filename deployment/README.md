*This folder must contain your deployment artifacts, e.g., Dockerfile. It should contain all the necessary artifacts to start the application, mockups or the microservices.*


# **I will be adding the name of the microservice in front of "Dockerfile" because I fear errors may happen if multiple docker files exist in 1 folder. Each corresponding docker file can be found in the microservice folder though.**
