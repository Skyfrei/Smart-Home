# What is GIT used for?

In this course, unless otherwise explicitly stated, your exercises will be submitted via GitLab. The last commit pushed before the deadline to the master branch on GitLab is decisive for the evaluation, grading, and feedback. The feedback will be provided here, i.e., on GitLab in a **DESIGN or FINAL milestone** respectively. To access these milestones check out the toolbar entry on the left named “Tickets” in German or “Issues” in English. The (preliminary) achieved points will be published using Moodle. 

**Do not change the name of the master branch**: it must be called master. Only data that is in the master branch before the deadline (therefore committed and pushed before the deadline) will be taken into account during the submission interviews and evaluation. Double check that you use the correct repository (i.e., the one relevant for this semester and this course). 


Use these git handles to specifically address a person in a Git issue. Please **do not use** @all as this would notify all supervisors, use the specific handle of your supervisor listed above. As a last resort, you can contact the course [email](mailto:ase@swa.univie.ac.at). 

# Which functions should not be used?

GitLab is a powerful software that allows you to customize numerous settings and choose from various features. We would advise you to treat these settings and features with **respect and care**. For example, by simply clicking on each button, ignoring warnings etc. one could delete this repositorie’s master branch for good (no we can’t restore it eather). So: Think before you click!
